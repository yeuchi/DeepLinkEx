Deeplink is an overloaded topic in Android. \
There is deeplink for launch an application to land on a specific page. \
There is applink that conforms to a web URL. \
Then there is implicit deeplink for navigation within the scope of an activity. \
Explicit deeplink deploys a notification and therefore have a global scope to reach all public activites.
